There was a time when I was alone

Nowhere to go and no place to call home

My only friend was the man in the Moon

And even, sometimes, he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes

I saw a shadow flying high

He came to me with the sweetest smile

Told me he wanted to talk for a while



He said, "Peter Pan, that's what they call me

I promise that you'll never be lonely"

And ever since that day



I am a Lost Boy from Neverland

Usually hanging out with Peter Pan

And when we're bored, we play in the woods

Always on the run from Captain Hook

"Run, run, Lost Boy," they say to me

"Away from all of reality"

Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me

And Lost Boys like me are free



Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me

And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe

Believe in him and believe in me

Together, we will fly away in a cloud of green

To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me

I realized, I finally had a family



Soon enough, we reached Neverland

Peacefully, my feet hit the sand

And ever since that day



I am a Lost Boy from Neverland

Usually hanging out with Peter Pan

And when we're bored, we play in the woods

Always on the run from Captain Hook

"Run, run, Lost Boy," they say to me

"Away from all of reality"

Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me

And Lost Boys like me are free

Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me

And Lost Boys like me are free



Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling

Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook

Neverland, I love you so

You are now my home sweet home

Forever a Lost Boy at last



Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling

Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook

Neverland, I love you so

You are now my home sweet home

Forever a Lost Boy at last

And for always, I will say



I am a Lost Boy from Neverland

Usually hanging out with Peter Pan

And when we're bored, we play in the woods

Always on the run from Captain Hook

"Run, run, Lost Boy," they say to me

"Away from all of reality"

Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me

And Lost Boys like me are free

Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me

And Lost Boys like me are free
